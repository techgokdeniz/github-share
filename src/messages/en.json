With this application, people can share their github accounts with each other and interact with these people by sorting their github accounts randomly or according to the number of followers or repositories. This application provides a platform for users to discover and interact with other users, follow them, and contribute to their projects by sharing their github profiles. Github Share Profile is a social network that encourages connection and information exchange among developers."
